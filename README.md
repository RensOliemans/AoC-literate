# Advent of Code

This is my code for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). My
solutions in [Clojure](https://clojure.org/), using [Literate
Programming](http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf).

The `src` directory only contains `utils.clj`, which I use in my
literate files, found in `org`.
